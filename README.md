# mortgage_app

Author: Steven Gore

Description:
A simple app that allows you to calculate a monthly payment for a home mortgage.

Coding languages used:
1. Vanilla javascript (es6)
2. Sass (scss)

Methodologies used:
BEM (block, element, modifier) for css

Validation:
The form checks for bad data and only allows for digits. 
For the range sliders, a user can only enter a value no larger than the max value and no smaller than the min value.

Notes:
ES6 javascript was run through a compiler for cross browser support and the javascript was also minified.
